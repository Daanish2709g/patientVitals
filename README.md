# PatientVitals

## Overview

The **PatientVitals** project is a Spring Boot-based application designed to track and manage the vital signs of patients. The application aims to provide healthcare professionals with a simple and efficient way to monitor patients' health metrics such as heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, oxygen levels, and more. The system allows for real-time tracking, storage, and analysis of patient data to ensure timely medical interventions.
    
### Key Features:
- **Patient Data Management**: Add, update, and view patients' vital signs.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuously monitor vital signs for patients.
- **Database Integration**: Data is stored in a relational database and can be accessed securely.
- **API Integration**: Exposes RESTful APIs for interaction with other systems or for frontend integration.
- **Scalable**: Easily extendable to include more features, such as patient history, alerts, and more.

## About This Repository

This repository contains the source code for the **PatientVitals** Spring Boot application. It includes:
- The **backend** application built with **Spring Boot**.
- RESTful APIs that allow the system to handle patient vitals data.
- **Database integration** using JPA (Java Persistence API) to store and retrieve patient information.

### Technologies Used:
- **Java 17** (or your chosen Java version)
- **Spring Boot** for building the backend and REST APIs.
- **Spring Data JPA** for database access.
- **H2 Database** (or you can replace it with any other relational database like MySQL, PostgreSQL).
- **Maven** for project build and dependency management.

### Project Structure:
- **`/src/main/java`**: Contains Java source code for the backend, including the models, controllers, services, and repositories.
- **`/src/main/resources`**: Contains configuration files like `application.properties`, and static resources.
- **`/target`**: Contains the compiled classes and JAR file after building the project.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- **JDK 17** or higher
- **Maven** for building the project (or use your IDE's built-in Maven support)
- A preferred **database** (H2 or configure your choice in `application.properties`).
